# Vue Training

To run the examples, in `App.vue` change the path of the example you want to run:

```
import Example from "./01-event-bus";
// ...
```

Then run `npm run serve`.

### Tests examples

For the test examples, just run `npm t` (equivalent to `npm run test`).

In watch mode: `npm t -- --watch`

If you need to run only a subset of examples, use the interactive tools provided by Jest watch mode.
